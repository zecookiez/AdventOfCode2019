## AdventOfCode2019
A series of challenges in spirit of the holidays ðŸŽ„

__Sad Update:__ I am postponing my progress on AoC temporarily due to schoolwork, so ranks will not be my goal this year. Efficiency and number of problems solved are still fair game when I come back :)

All of these solutions will be written and verified with Python, along with the following goals:
1. __Efficiency,__ where a more efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for sub-15 seconds using plain Python2.7 (no PyPy or JIT compilers allowed) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability.
3. __Keep it simple!__

## Notable Nights

- Day 5: Lost plenty of time to misreading the problem.
- Day 6: Time lost from missing the constraint of the root node.
