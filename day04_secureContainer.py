    Doing a loop from [low, high] would suffice for this problem,
        as the upper bound of numbers to check is 10^6, resulting in O(N * K) where N is the size of range and K is the number of digits.
        
    That took ~250ms with Python2, and there are a lot of better ways to find the candidates:
        
        - Strictly nondecreasing digits will cut down most candidates (My input had only 476 numbers that fit this criteria!)
        
        This leads to a recursive function that generates all possible numbers digit-by-digit.
    
    What's more convenient is how we can easily find adjacent equal pairs.
    
    The following code takes < 1ms of time in Python2, which is way better than what I was aiming for :)
